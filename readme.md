## About LSTM

LSTM are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf), and were refined and popularized by many peoplo in following work [[Sundermeyer et al. (2012)](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/i12_0194.html), [Zhou, Chunting, et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08630), [Gensler, Andr√©, et al.
